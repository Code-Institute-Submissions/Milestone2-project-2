-About Us
-What we do
-Packages

Discover Page (discover.html)
-Google Map with Locations
-Current Weather
-Attractions Gallery
-Contact Form

Need some help? (quiz.html)
-Did you know facts?

Footer includes contact page link and repeats menu options from Navbar for UX ease.  
Home button is stylised through Font Awesome.

* Contact Form (EmailJS)
