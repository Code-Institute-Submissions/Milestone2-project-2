Wireframes generally reamined true to website design.  Index page is included above.  Whilst details
would still be filled in, the layout of each page type generally remained the same throughout the process and
across devices.

## Features

The website uses Bootstrap 4.4.1 due to its layout and responsiveness.  Custom alterations are made
in order to increase customisation of website e.g, color schemes and spacing. 

The following features are also included throughout the page (external sources attributed).

* Navbar (Bootstrap 4.4.1, Font Awesome and Google Fonts)
Navbar includes company name styled with 2 different fonts for impact and to emphasise appeal to children.  Bootstrap 4 was used
to set layout. Navbar links hover red.

* Content (Font Awesome)
Font Awesome icons are used throughout the page.  Various icons are coloured/re-sized using CSS.

* Background images via CSS
Images are styled using CSS and written as background images.  As images are non-essential
and do not contain any information, this is why this was done as opposed to using a HTML tag.

* Footer (Bootstrap 4.4.1 and Font Awesome)
Footer includes contact page link and repeats menu options from Navbar for UX ease.  
Home button is stylised through Font Awesome.

* Form (Bootstrap 4.4.1)
On the contact page, the form is used to collect user contact info.  Form submission is currently
empty.

* Links to social media pages (currently to general social media sites).
